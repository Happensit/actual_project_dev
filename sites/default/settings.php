/**
 * @file
 * Drupal site-specific configuration file.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 * This file may have been set to read-only by the Drupal installation program.
 * If you make changes to this file, be sure to protect it again after making
 * your modifications. Failure to remove write permissions to this file is a
 * security risk.
 *
 * The configuration file to be loaded is based upon the rules below. However
 * if the multisite aliasing file named sites/sites.php is present, it will be
 * loaded, and the aliases in the array $sites will override the default
 * directory rules below. See sites/example.sites.php for more information about
 * aliases.
 *
 * The configuration directory will be discovered by stripping the website's
 * hostname from left to right and pathname from right to left. The first
 * configuration file found will be used and any others will be ignored. If no
 * other configuration file is found then the default configuration file at
 * 'sites/default' will be used.
 *
 * For example, for a fictitious site installed at
 * http://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/, the 'settings.php' file is searched
 * for in the following directories:
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite.test
 * - sites/org.mysite.test
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/www.drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/drupal.org.mysite
 * - sites/org.mysite
 *
 * - sites/8080.www.drupal.org
 * - sites/www.drupal.org
 * - sites/drupal.org
 * - sites/org
 *
 * - sites/default
 *
 * Note that if you are installing on a non-standard port number, prefix the
 * hostname with that number. For example,
 * http://www.drupal.org:8080/mysite/test/ could be loaded from
 * sites/8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test/.
 *
 * @see example.sites.php

/**
 * Reverse Proxy Configuration:
 *
 * Reverse proxy servers are often used to enhance the performance
 * of heavily visited sites and may also provide other site caching,
 * security, or encryption benefits. In an environment where Drupal
 * is behind a reverse proxy, the real IP address of the client should
 * be determined such that the correct client IP address is available
 * to Drupal's logging, statistics, and access management systems. In
 * the most simple scenario, the proxy server will add an
 * X-Forwarded-For header to the request that contains the client IP
 * address. However, HTTP headers are vulnerable to spoofing, where a
 * malicious client could bypass restrictions by setting the
 * X-Forwarded-For header directly. Therefore, Drupal's proxy
 * configuration requires the IP addresses of all remote proxies to be
 * specified in $conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'] to work correctly.
 *
 * Enable this setting to get Drupal to determine the client IP from
 * the X-Forwarded-For header (or $conf['reverse_proxy_header'] if set).
 * If you are unsure about this setting, do not have a reverse proxy,
 * or Drupal operates in a shared hosting environment, this setting
 * should remain commented out.
 *
 * In order for this setting to be used you must specify every possible
 * reverse proxy IP address in $conf['reverse_proxy_addresses'].
 * If a complete list of reverse proxies is not available in your
 * environment (for example, if you use a CDN) you may set the
 * $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] variable directly in settings.php.
 * Be aware, however, that it is likely that this would allow IP
 * address spoofing unless more advanced precautions are taken.

/**
 * Page caching:

 * By default, Drupal sends a "Vary: Cookie" HTTP header for anonymous page
 * views. This tells a HTTP proxy that it may return a page from its local
 * cache without contacting the web server, if the user sends the same Cookie
 * header as the user who originally requested the cached page. Without "Vary:
 * Cookie", authenticated users would also be served the anonymous page from
 * the cache. If the site has mostly anonymous users except a few known
 * editors/administrators, the Vary header can be omitted. This allows for
 * better caching in HTTP proxies (including reverse proxies), i.e. even if
 * clients send different cookies, they still get content served from the cache.
 * However, authenticated users should access the site directly (i.e. not use an
 * HTTP proxy, and bypass the reverse proxy if one is used) in order to avoid
 * getting cached pages from the proxy.

 * files to browsers that accept gzip encoded content. This allows pages to load
 * faster for these users and has minimal impact on server load. If you are
 * using a webserver other than Apache httpd, or a caching reverse proxy that is
 * configured to cache and compress these files itself you may want to uncomment

/**
 * Authorized file system operations:
 *
 * The Update manager module included with Drupal provides a mechanism for

 * directly through the web user interface. On securely-configured servers,
 * the Update manager will require the administrator to provide SSH or FTP
 * credentials before allowing the installation to proceed; this allows the
 * site to update the new files as the user who owns all the Drupal files,
 * instead of as the user the webserver is running as. On servers where the
 * webserver user is itself the owner of the Drupal files, the administrator
 * will not be prompted for SSH or FTP credentials (note that these server
 * setups are common on shared hosting, but are inherently insecure).
 *
 * Some sites might wish to disable the above functionality, and only update
 * the code directly via SSH or FTP themselves. This setting completely
 * disables all functionality related to these authorized file operations.

 * @see http://drupal.org/node/244924
